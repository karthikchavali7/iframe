  <h1 style="background-color: red;"><marquee direction="up" scrollamount="20">Jeff Bezos and his partner Lauren Sanchez were recently snapped soaking the sun on board ‘Koru’ off the coast of Spain.
    Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's new yacht Koru is the talk of the town these days, days after he and his partner Lauren Sanchez were spotted soaking up the sun off the coast of Spain.
    
    At 417 feet, ‘Koru’ is said to be the world's largest sailing yacht costing $500 million ( ₹4,145 crore), and has numerous features which makes the stay a royal experience. Here are five important things to know about this super luxurious possession of Bezos.
    
    1. The name ‘Koru’ is actually a Maori (indigenous people of New Zealand) term for a coil or a loop which symbolises new life, growth and peace. In fact, the Amazon founder had included a photo of a koru frond in an Instagram post last year.
    
    2. Talking about the design, Koru is a large sailboat with three masts, an on-deck pool and a mermaid-like structure on the bow, bearing resemblance to Bezos' partner Lauren Sanchez, New York Times reported.

    3. This sailing yacht will be trailed by a 246-foot support vessel Abeona. This vessel is for carrying ATVs, supercars, seaplanes, motorcycles, smaller boats etc. It can carry them along with dozens of crew members. It has three huge 229-foot masts which power it to a speed of 20 knots.</marquee></h1>
