Early on Sunday, PM Modi paid tribute to the memory of Hiroshima victims at the Peace Memorial Museum. The prime minister is currently on his third in-person Quad leaders’ meeting wherein he met Ukrainian President Zelenskyy on Saturday and held bilateral talks with other member states. Earlier today, he discussed the India-UK free trade agreement, innovation and science with UK PM Rishi Sunak. PM Modi wore a jacket made of recycled material at the G7 summit in Japan on Sunday. The leaders of the world’s most powerful democracies have come together in deliberations on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and vouched for peace via diplomacy too. The G7 includes Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada and Italy, as well as the European Union.</marquee></h1>
